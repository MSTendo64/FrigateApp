# FrigateApp

A simple desktop application for managing your Frigate NVR backend. Written in C# with AvaloniaUI for a cross-platform experience.

## What is this?

This is a basic desktop client for [Frigate](https://frigate.video/), an open-source NVR (Network Video Recorder). It aims to provide a native desktop interface for interacting with your Frigate instance, separate from the web interface.

## Current Status

⚠️ **Very Early Alpha**  
This is a work in progress. Version `0.1-ALPHA` was just released, and many features are likely missing or incomplete. Expect bugs and breaking changes.

## Project Structure

- **Language**: C# (.NET)
- **UI Framework**: [AvaloniaUI](https://avaloniaui.net/) (for cross-platform support)
- **Target**: Desktop application (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) installed (version compatible with the project).
2.  **Clone** the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MSTendo64/FrigateApp.git
    cd FrigateApp
    ```
3.  **Build** the application:
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ```
4.  **Run** it (from the project directory):
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

## Goals

The primary goal is to create a straightforward, performant desktop alternative to the web interface for local Frigate server management.
